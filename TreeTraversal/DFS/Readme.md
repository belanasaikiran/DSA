### Pre Order Traversal

The pre order traversal visits the root node first, then the left subtree, and finally the right subtree.

> The node is visited before its left and right children have been visited. This means that the node is visited first in the traversal.


### Post Order Traversal

In post order traversal, we visit the left subtree, then the right subtree, and finally the root node.

> The node is visited after its left and right children have been visited. This means that the node is visited last in the traversal.


### In Order Traversal

In in order traversal, we visit the left subtree, then the root node, and finally the right subtree.

> The node is visited after its left child has been visited, but before its right child has been visited. This means that the node is visited in the middle of the traversal.
