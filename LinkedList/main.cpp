// NOTE: Classes help in creating Linked List also.
// LinkedList: The class has default constructor to take first value, has functions to append, prepend, insert, delete, remove Last
//
// Main important Data Structure

// NOTE: Linked Lists
// Data is not stored in contiguous location. It is stored at different places of location. We use header and tail for point to next value in a different location. So, we just remember the location of data value instead of storing everything sequentially. It helps in growing memory dynamically instead of having fixed sized value. Although the search operation would be time consuming since we need to check each and every value

// - First Node is HEAD
// - Last Node is tail and is pointed to NULL
// Each node is pointed to next node's address. 
//
//
// In arrays, its different, it stores everything in a contiguous space in memory
