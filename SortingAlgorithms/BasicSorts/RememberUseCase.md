> Used ChatGPT to remember the difference between Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, and Selection Sort.

Prompt: how do I easily remember bubble sort vs insertion sort vs selection sort ?

Response: That’s a super common question — and you’re not alone! Here's a simple, **visual and real-world analogy-based** way to remember the difference between **Bubble Sort**, **Insertion Sort**, and **Selection Sort**:

---

## 🫧 Bubble Sort → “Bubble to the top”
**Analogy**: Think of **bubbles rising** in water.

- Biggest element **bubbles up** to the end on each pass.
- Compare adjacent items and **swap** if out of order.
- **Slow but simple** — lots of swapping.

🔁 Outer loop shrinks from end
🔁 Inner loop compares `arr[j]` and `arr[j+1]`

### 📌 Easy Mnemonic:
> "Bubble sort = Swap neighbors until big ones float to the top."

## 🪡 Insertion Sort → “Sort like playing cards”
**Analogy**: Imagine **sorting cards in your hand** — you pick a new card and insert it into the right spot in the already-sorted portion.

- Builds a sorted list **one element at a time**.
- Picks an element and **inserts** it into the correct place.
- Great for **nearly sorted** arrays!

🔁 Outer loop goes from 1 to n
🔁 Inner loop shifts sorted values to the right

### 📌 Easy Mnemonic:
> "Insertion = Insert card into sorted hand."

---

## 🧩 Selection Sort → “Pick the smallest”
**Analogy**: You’re **selecting clothes** from a messy pile. Each time, you pick the **smallest item** and put it in its place.

- Find the **smallest element** in the rest of the array.
- Swap it with the current index.
- Only **one swap per outer loop** — more efficient in terms of swaps than bubble sort.

🔁 Outer loop selects index to place smallest
🔁 Inner loop searches for the smallest remaining value

### 📌 Easy Mnemonic:
> "Selection = Select smallest and place it."

## ✨ Summary Table:

| Sort           | How it works                     | Analogy                     | Best For                     |
|----------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------|
| Bubble Sort    | Repeatedly swap neighbors        | Bubbles floating to top     | Learning / simple logic      |
| Insertion Sort | Insert into sorted part          | Sorting cards in hand       | Nearly sorted arrays         |
| Selection Sort | Select smallest and swap         | Picking clothes in order    | Fewest swaps needed          |
