### Maps in C++

A map is a collection of key-value pairs. In C++, the map is implemented using the `std::map` class. The keys in a map are unique, and each key is associated with a value. The keys are used to access the values in the map.

Two Types of Maps:
1. Ordered Map - using Red-Black Tree
2. Unordered Map - using Hash Table


### Complexity Analysis

The time complexity for ordered maps is O(log n) for insertion, deletion, and searching. The time complexity for unordered maps is O(1) for insertion, deletion, and searching.
