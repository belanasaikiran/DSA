1. [Insertion Sort](./Insertion_Sort/main.cpp)
	- Initially, it assumes the first element is already sorted. It takes the second element of an array and compares with first. 
	- If the first element is greater than 2nd, it swaps or else it ignores. 
	- Next, it takes the 3rd element, checks with 2nd if smaller, swap and repeat the same with 1st element. 
	- and so on..
