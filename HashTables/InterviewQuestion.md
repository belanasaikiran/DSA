1. Given two arrays, if these two arrays have common elements, return true, else return false.

Eg:
Arr1 = [1, 3, 5]
Arr2 = [2, 4, 5]

if we loop through loop, it is O(n^2) time complexity. But we can use hash tables to reduce the time complexity to O(n).

![commonItem](./commonItem.cpp)

This is O(n) time complexity.
